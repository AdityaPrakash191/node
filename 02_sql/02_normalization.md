`Normalization` : It is the process of determining how much redundency exist in table & it gives techniques to reduce it.

`First Normal Form (1NF)` : any attribute must only contain atomic (indivisible) values.

`Second Normal Form (2NF)` : the table should not have partial dependencies & the table should be already 1NF.

`Third Normal Form (3NF)` : It should not have transitive dependency & the table should be already 2NF.

`BCNF Boyce Cod Normal Form` : It must be 3NF , for any dependency A -> B , A must be super key.
